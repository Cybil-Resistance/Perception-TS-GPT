"Shock, watch out. Looks like the Warlord is riding in on a mech. Big ass one too."

The MetaExplorer looked up from her Vortex cannon and sprouted a maniacal grin. "Oh yeah. That's one sexy death robot. Gotta be a Nexus model. Hoping to get an Oberon myself one day. But bigger they are, bigger they fall, right?"

Freddy shrugged. He didn't know much about mechs besides you didn't want to fight one unless you were strapped into a mech of your own. He had a few Ordinance class weapons in his inventory, some mech parts he was planning on taking to Pretty's when the whole challenge was over, and he even had looted a legendary mech mod during Wave Five. But he had no mech of his own yet, which didn't leave him with many options when faced with a Nexus model, the best mechs publicly available with the highest Power, Speed, and Endurance ratings. Hopefully one of his companions had something up their sleeves, otherwise, their whole run was over and it would be a whole cycle before they could give it another go.

He wasn't exactly looking forward to being d-mezzed either, with all the gear and loot he had picked up since arriving in Waste Land!. It had been quite the experience gating into the middle of the strange apocalyptic theme park that served as the world's central hub. A d-mezzing meant all his active inventory, filled with items he had painstakingly gathered here in Waste Land! would get burned. And he wasn't even counting all the items he had already used up to boost his stats in hopes of making it to the end and proving himself worthy of the Winners Circle.

"Looks like Mr. Warlord has a whole army of drones along with him. Power level looks pretty low though. All coming up green for me." Shock.wav's cybernetic eyes were opened wide, emitting a flat plane of red light that scanned the approaching MOBs.

Freddy adjusted his display to show Power level, and sure enough, the army of haphazard robots, held together with tape and splashes of graffiti, all shimmered a pale green, barely enough of a threat to grant exp and loot. The Warlord's mech however shone like a hateful crimson sun, a color reserved for the hardest MOBs and raid bosses. If every single one of the Broker hopefuls had been here, still fresh and ready with their HP high and ammo full, they might have stood a chance. But now it was just the three of them, spent and weary. Might even just be the two of them, since 1Win had decided she was better off hiding than confronting this monstrosity.

The sand cloud had settled now, the vast array of the Warlord's forces on full display as they shambled over the arid wastes, the giant mech towered over the scavenged drones, crushing some of its own with every stride. The broken remnants were picked up by the drones rushing in behind, adding the scavenged pieces to their own twisted forms.

Then Shock.wav let loose her Vortex Cannon.

A tiny black sphere rushed across the barren landscape, sucking up sand and hot, blistering air, before crashing into the front of the robot army with a silent ripping of the universe. The tear swallowed the entire horizon in nothingness. Freddy was worried it would expand and pull the whole Paradigm in, but then it reached its terrifying crescendo, shuddered like the last breath of a corpse, and withered to nothing in an instant.

The robot army was gone. Completely devoured by the horrid darkness. A few twisted metal limbs twitched in the scattered sands, but all that remained of the Warlord's vast army was the gigantic mech, alone and untouched. The Warlord's mech continued to lumber forward, feet crunching the rapidly fragmenting remnants of its army deeper into the blasted sand. It would be on them in a handful of tixs, and Freddy couldn't see a path to victory. Maybe survive as long as possible in hopes that there was a pity prize for the last hopeful standing.

In a feeble survival attempt, he switched out his gear for a set of Ironwood Armor he had painstakingly collected over in The Thirteen Groves, a Beta World that looked a lot friendlier than the terrain stretched before him here in Waste Land!. The armor's fantasy aesthetic clashed with the nuclear apocalypse motif of War World, but it had some of the highest defensive stats currently available. At least it would allow him to survive a hit or two from a Nexus. Probably.

A wave of small canisters erupted from the mech as it closed the distance, fanning out in the air and leaving a trail of green gas as they came crashing down around Freddy. He ran as fast as he could away from Shock.wav, hoping that splitting the mech's fire would give some slight advantage. As he ran, canisters exploding into toxic green clouds around him, Freddy scrolled through his list of meds and bevs, consuming any he thought might have value. Speed Potion, Rad Killer, HP Max soda (limited-edition orange/red flavor), Pirate 'Gram…sure, why not!

Looking like an 1800s pirate and glowing with a half dozen effects, Freddy broke free from the toxin cloud as the Warlord mech sprayed a volley of depleted uranium shells into the space he just vacated. Shock.wav yelled in defiance and erupted up out of the cloud on neon metallic wings, returning fire with a beautiful antique rifle right out of a classic western, except for it shot hot-pink energy bolts instead of .56 caliber bullets. Scorch marks appeared along the mech's armor, as it tried to track the soaring MetaExplorer, but Shock.wav was too quick; zigging when it zagged, going low when it went high. Freddy couldn't help but be impressed. But impressed or not, he couldn't let Shock.wav grab all the glory and, more importantly, all the points.

"Might as well go all out," Freddy mumbled, flipping to the highest weapons in his inventory, a Plasma Rocket Launcher he had been saving for over 900 cycles. Sure. Why the fuck not!

The sandy wastes around them became a whirlwind of explosions, flames, and energy plumes. Shock.wav continued to soar circles around the mech, keeping the Warlord mostly distracted with her blazing pink gunfire as Freddy unloaded an arsenal many cycles in the making into a precise joint on the side of the mech's knee. Dodge, fire, dodge, fire. Most boss encounters had a rhythm to them. A pattern that if discovered could be used to avoid the worst the boss had to offer. The problem was that most bosses also had a timer of some sort, that if not defeated quickly enough would trigger some event that pretty much guaranteed a d-mezzing. He couldn't imagine that just two of them could take a boss down before the rage timer flipped on.

"Hey. Psst. Five-fingers or whatever your name is…"

The whisper behind Freddy almost sent him diving in the wrong direction into a pool of radiative ooze.

He pivoted at that last second as the pool erupted in a shower of deadly radiation before fading away to nothingness. He sent another spray of bullets into the knee joint of the Mech and then addressed the two footprints and hazy patch of air nearby. "What do you want, 1Win?"

"You're shooting at the wrong spot."

Dodge, fire, dodge, fire, don't move too far away from 1Win.

"You're free to join in any time now."

"Not a good time for me. Sorry. But you should be aiming for the tube along its spine, just below the central fastener. The one filled with radioactive goop. Do you see it?"

It was hard to miss since the tube was probably 10 times as thick as Freddy himself and spanned the whole back of the towering mech.

"Yes, I see it! But I don't have much ammo left that can even put a dent in this thing. Don't think switching targets is going to help."

"Shooting its reinforced leg joint isn't going to help either."

Freddy shot a glare back at the hazy air, which forced him to expend an Evasion boost to avoid getting trampled as the mech brought its foot down. Arguing with 1Win was throwing off his rhythm and all it would take was one hit to bring his HP to 0.

"What do you even know? You haven't helped one bit over nine Waves!"

The whisper sounded rather indignant. "Because I'm a Mechanic, duh. Don't know why you're acting so high and mighty. You're just a Leftover. What do you even know about anything?"

This discussion wasn't going to get them anywhere, and she did have a point. Mechanics knew just about everything there was to know about machinery, vehicles, and mechs. So, swallowing his pride, Freddy dodged and dodged again to get a good firing arc, switched his targeting upwards to the giant tube running along the mech's back, and unloaded his last clip into it.

Nothing happened. Not a scratch. The mech kept up its rampage trying to swat the MetaExplorer out of the air, and now Freddy was out of any effective long-range weapons.

"Cool. Thanks for that, 1Win."

"No, no. That was perfect. I wasn't sure which fastener was the weak point. I only have one shot at this."

"Shot at-" Freddy didn't have the chance to finish his question.

The haze around 1Win turned purple and then disappeared entirely with a quiet pop. There was another louder pop and a small cloud of angry purple energy appeared on the back of the Warlord's mech, just below the upper fastener. The energy quickly resolved itself into 1Win, holding a giant sword that glowed with the pure blue light of a thousand proton stars. As she fell, she swung the blade with all her might into the large green gunky tube, severing it neatly. Radioactive ooze sprayed out in a violent geyser, catching 1Win just before she vanished in another pop of purple energy.

An instant later she appeared next to Freddy, shrieking in frustration as her avatar melted away wherever the ooze had touched her.

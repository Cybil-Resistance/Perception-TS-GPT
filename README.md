# Perception, a Typescript GPT Implementation

Inspired by Auto-GPT, Perception is a Node.JS / Typescript implementation with some important changes:

1. Written in Typescript due to familiarity with Node
1. Auto-GPT has some limitations that I'd like to work around
1. Perception is intended to have more complex logic and more freedom
